    Some moving around and rotating happens here:

    note: if u move fistObject (whichever that is) up, it will start from origin (where car is)
    but secondObject's starting point will be fistObject'center.    

    u may need to rotate torus so it faces up.
    draw on paper first, hardcoding shit wont work cause brisson will know
    and we need paper for brisson, brisson likes paper, brisson was there when paper was invented
    he was the grandfather of the guy who invented paper

    cilinder.rotation.someAxis = some useful number shit
    object.position.x = some other useful shit
    object.position.y = some other useful shit
    object.position.z = some other useful shit
